##LINUX-BASICS 3 OP (NONSTOP)

These were the programs I wrote in the Bash scripting open tasks section.

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to Linux, alongside GCC.
